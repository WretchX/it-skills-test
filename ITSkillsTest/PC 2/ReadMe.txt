PC2 Environment:

(Chrome)
- ScamExample disables the usage of F11, there's no way to disable ESC so I just popped the Esc key off

Please edit the included Google Chrome shortcut to match the path to ScamExample.html

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --kiosk C:\Path\To\ScamExample.html

(Desktop)
- Share folder on desktop. Inside is a picture of a cat. Any photo will work, but it must be called "photo.jpg" to pass the test on PC1.

- Just a reminder the logged in user of this PC must have a password to be able to share files across the network, I put the username and password to the test login on a sticky note
